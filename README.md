# easy-vim

The whole purpose of this is my annoyance towards those vim plugins that reqiuire python or node plugins.

## Plan

My plan is to use built-in vim completion, with some tweaks. It sometimes works good, but needs some tweaks.

## Instalation

Just copy .vimrc and .vim to your home directory.

## Keybindings

The leader key can be different depending on system. For me it's `\`. You can map it whatever key you want in `.vimrc` line 41.

* lead + n - directory tree 
* lead + t - new tab
* lead + s - vertical split
* tab - move between workplaces
